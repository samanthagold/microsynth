Description: A generalization of the 'Synth' package that is designed for
    data at a more granular level (e.g., micro-level). Provides functions
    to construct weights (including propensity score-type weights) and run
    analyses for synthetic control methods with micro- and meso-level
    data; see Robbins, Saunders, and Kilmer (2017)
